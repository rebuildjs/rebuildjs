# rebuildjs
Simple hackable alternative to vite for Multi-Page Apps.

This library provides esbuild functions for dev & production environments. It is a dependency to be integrated with 
an app server.

An example is [relysjs](https://github.com/rebuildjs/relysjs), which uses [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) as the 
web server.
