# rebuildjs
Simple hackable alternative to vite for Multi-Page Apps.

This library provides esbuild functions for dev & production environments. It forms a core for an app server stack.

An example is [relysjs](https://github.com/relysjs/relysjs). relysjs uses [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) as the web server.
